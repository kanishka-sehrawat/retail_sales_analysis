# Retail Sales Analysis SQL Project

## Project Overview

**Project Title:- Retail Sale Analysis
**Level: Beginner
**Database :'retail_db'

This project is designed to demonstrate SQL skills and techniques typically used by data analysts to explore, clean, and analyze retail sales data. The project involves setting up a retail sales database, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and answering specific business questions through SQL queries.

## Objectives
1. **Set up a retail sales database**: Create and populate a retail sales database with the provided sales data.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Identify and remove any records with missing or null values.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform basic exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset.
4. **Business Analysis**: Use SQL to answer specific business questions and derive insights from the sales data

# Project Structure

### 1. Database Setup

- **Database Creation**: The project starts by creating a database named `retail_db`.
- **Table Creation**: A table named `retail_sales` is created to store the sales data. The table structure includes columns for transaction ID, sale date, sale time, customer ID, gender, age, product category, quantity sold, price per unit, cost of goods sold (COGS), and total sale amount.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE retail_db
(
    transactions_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    sale_date DATE,	
    sale_time TIME,
    customer_id INT,	
    gender VARCHAR(10),
    age INT,
    category VARCHAR(35),
    quantity INT,
    price_per_unit FLOAT,	
    cogs FLOAT,
    total_sale FLOAT
);
```

### 2. Data Exploration & Cleaning

- **Record Count**: Determine the total number of records in the dataset.
- **Customer Count**: Find out how many unique customers are in the dataset.
- **Category Count**: Identify all unique product categories in the dataset.
- **Null Value Check**: Check for any null values in the dataset and delete records with missing data.

``` sql
select * from retail_sales;

select COUNT(*) as total_rows from retail_sales;
select count(*) as total_sales from retail_sales;

1. **how many unique customers we have?
select count(distinct customer_id) as total_customers from retail_sales;

2. **how many unique category we have?
select distinct category from retail_sales;

select * from retail_sales
where transactions_id is null
or sale_date is null
or sale_time is null
or customer_id is null
or gender is null
or age is null
or category is null
or quantity is null;

delete  from retail_sales 
where transactions_id is null
or sale_date is null
or sale_time is null
or customer_id is null
or gender is null
or age is null
or category is null
or quantity is null;
```
